# Make the landing page “wow” without chaos

## 1) Compose the hero like a poster, not a brochure

* **One idea, one sentence.** Big headline + one-line subhead. Move everything else below the fold.
* **Science moment:** a subtle **constellation/aurora canvas** behind the headline with slow glints and fine star-link lines. Not busy—just a living hint that this is science with heart.
* **Kill the sidebar at the top.** Put “Notes from the field” further down.
* **Two CTAs only:** Donate (primary) and Browse magazines (secondary). Volunteer sits in the top nav.

## 2) Reshuffle the first screen (declutter)

* Above the fold: **Tagline → Headline → One-line subhead → Two CTAs → Tiny trust row** (“Since 2020 · Volunteer-run · TT”).
* Next band: **“What we do, simply”** as 3 icon blocks (Gifts, Groceries, Science Month/Magazine). Each block links down the page.
* Then: **Featured publication card** (the 2025 issue) with cover on the right, short blurb on left, Download button.
* Then: **Notes from the field** (the bullets you have) as a quiet glass card.

## 3) Visual rhythm

* Alternate **full-bleed dark band** → **centered content band** → full-bleed again.
* Use one depth: hero = bold; subsequent cards = quiet. Right now everything has similar contrast.
* Increase line-length just a touch (65–72ch) but cap headline to **2–3 lines** at desktop.

## 4) Gentle motion (1–2 micro-interactions)

* **Star glints:** 2–3 faint stars twinkle at different intervals.
* **CTA glow breathe:** 4-second ease-in/out luminance pulse on Donate.
* Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

# Hero copy you can paste (three flavors)

## A) Warm science (default)

**Tag:** W.I.S.H. · Women in Science for Hope
**Headline:** Science, books, and care—delivered with heart.
**Subhead (one line):** A volunteer-run Trinidad & Tobago charity supporting children’s homes since 2020.
**CTAs:** Donate · Browse magazines

## B) Astronomy-leaning (Prof-pleaser)

**Tag:** Trinidad & Tobago · Since 2020
**Headline:** Wonder under the night sky. Care in every home.
**Subhead:** We share science, books, and practical support with children’s homes—powered by volunteers.
**CTAs:** Donate · Explore the WISH library

## C) Magazine-centred

**Tag:** WISH Upon a Star · Annual print for kids
**Headline:** Joyful science made local—and placed in little hands.
**Subhead:** Volunteers write it, print it, and deliver it alongside books and essentials.
**CTAs:** Donate · Download the latest issue

*Tiny trust row under CTAs (muted chips):* **Volunteer-run** · **Registered since 2021** · **Trinidad & Tobago**

# Section titles that feel premium (quick swaps)

* “Annual rhythm” → **What we do**
* “Season of Joy – Gifts for Children” → **Gifts for Children (December)**
* “Groceries & Toiletries Drive” → **Groceries & Essentials (Mar–Apr)**
* “Science Month Kits & Nights” → **Science Month + Sky Nights (September)**
* “WISH Upon a Star – Annual Magazine” → **WISH Upon a Star (July)**

Keep the existing bullets; just let the headings carry the weight.

# Minimal design moves to sell the astronomy vibe

* **Constellation garnish:** a few thin lines connecting 5–7 hero stars; fade to 0% at 900px down the page so it doesn’t clutter.
* **Aurora band:** you already have a gradient; narrow it vertically so the hero has a bright crown and a darker lower half for text legibility.
* **Icon trio:** Use a consistent thin-line style (🎁, 🛒, 🔭/📖). Same size, same weight.

# Why this works

* The hero becomes a poster with a single idea and clean CTAs, not a summary paragraph salad.
* The science motif is tasteful (constellations + aurora), not clip-art.
* People instantly know **what WISH is** and **what to click**. Then they scroll into structured, low-noise sections.

If you want, I can turn Option B into a tiny code patch (classes only) that hides the right panel in the hero, adds the star-glint layer, and swaps the headings—your content files stay untouched.
